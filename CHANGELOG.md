## 0.9.0 Split from KubeRun

This version is the first release of the more advanced `kubernetes` backend split from the `kuberun` backend. This backend introduces the ability to run several commands using the `exec` mechanism and adds support for the [ContainerSSH Guest Agent](https://github.com/containerssh/agent).
